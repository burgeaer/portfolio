    <p>Hi! My name is Aeryn(Erin) Nicole Burgess(Bur-giss). I am a Web Developer, with a background in programming. It did not start out that way however, In fact, I originally did not want to become a Web Developer at all. What I wanted to be was a singer!</p>  
<p>It is kind of shocking, right? Especially considering I was able to make this whole website from scratch, and gained two Associates Degrees in Web Development. But yes, I wanted to be a singer. I was a choir singer at a young age, and I loved music. To me, that was the art form I wanted to excel in more than anything. I was going to move out at 18 and finally make a name for myself. Even if my parents didn't agree.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that did not happen. I did not move and I did not pursue my dreams of being a singer. My parents told me I did not have enough drive or financial stability to achieve my dreams of being a singer. That not only angered me but it made me feel like I wasn't enough, and I did not know what I wanted to do anymore. I knew I could not give up, but I was so lost. How could I still do both? Well, I stumbled upon Web Development my Junior year of high school. It was challenging at first and was not totally sold on it being as great as singing. However, As soon as I started my Senior year, I fell in love. Problem solving and fixing problems and also creating intricate websites became my haven. Then it hit me, I could do both; I could still sing as a hobby, and I could develop web sites as a career!</p>
<p>Coding is what got me out the worst times of my life, and has given me more drive than anything before. It is extraordinary what can be accomplished with just HTML5 and CSS3, and I still have much to learn. Technology is always changing and that is what I love most about this. The ability to continue learning keeps my interest in this field, and I am excited for this to finally become my full-time career!</p>
