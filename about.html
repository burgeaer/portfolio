  <p>Hi, My name is Aeryn(Erin) Nicole Burgess(Bur-giss). I am 23 years old and a Junior Web Developer with a little bit of programming knowledge.
However, it did not start out that way. In fact, I did not want to be a Web Developer, I wanted to be a singer. </p>
  <p>It is kind of shocker, right? Considering I made this whole website from scratch and according to my <a href="resume.html">Resume I have two associate degrees in Web Development, but yes, I wanted to be a singer. I was a choir singer at young age, and I really loved music. To me that was the art form I wanted to excel in more than anything. It was meant to be. I was going to move out at 18 and leave my depressing home to do what I wanted. </p>
  <p>Unfortunately, that did not happen. My parents told me I was not driven enough or financially stable enough to do what I wanted. That was the first time I felt depressed. I was so depressed in fact. I did not know what I wanted to do anymore. I knew that I couldn't give up, but I was so lost as to what to do. 
I stumbled upon Web Development when I was Junior in high school, and I liked it. As soon as I started doing my senior year, I started to love it. Problem solving and fixing problems plus creating intricate websites became my haven. So, when I was told I could not do what I wanted to do. I realized I could do both, I could still sing as a hobby and I could be website developer as a career. </p>
    <p>Coding to me is what has gotten me out the worst times in my life. It has given more drive to do more than singing ever has. It is amazing what you can do with HTML5 and CSS3 and I still have a lot to learn. Technology is always changing and that is what I love most about this. To continue to learn is what keeps me interested in this field. I can't wait for this to be my full-time career. </p>
