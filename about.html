    <p>Hi! My name is Aeryn(Erin) Nicole Burgess(Bur-giss). I am a 23 year-old Web Developer with a little bit of programming knowledge. It did not start out that way however, In fact, I originally did not want to become a Web Developer at all --  I wanted to be a singer!</p>  
<p>It is kind of shocker, right? Especially considering I was able to make this whole website from scratch, and gain two Associtates Degrees in Web Development. But yes, I wanted to be a singer. I was a choir singer at a young age, and I really loved music. To me, that was the art form I wanted to excel in more than anything. It was meant to be. I was going to move out at 18 and leave my depressing home to do what I wanted.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that did not happen. After I had been in high school a couple of years, my parents told me I did not have enough drive or financial stability to achieve my dreams of being a singer. That was the first time I felt depressed, and I did not know what I wanted to do anymore. I knew I couldn't give up, but I was so lost as to what to do. I stumbled upon Web Development when I was a Junior, and I started to find that I liked it. As soon as I started entered my senior year, I started to love it. Problem solving and fixing problems and also creating intricate websites became my haven. So, while I had been told I could not achieve my original dream, I realized I could do both; I could still sing as a hobby, and I could develop Websites as a career!</p>
<p>Coding is what got me out the worst times of my life, and has given me more drive than anything before. It is amazing what can be accomplished with just HTML5 and CSS3, and I still have a lot to learn. Technology is always changing and that is what I love most about this. The ability to continue learning keeps my interest in this field, and I am excited for this to finally become my full-time career!</p>
